## 🌐 Network-Wide Rules

### 🗣️ Server Social Rules

- No racism, sexism, homophobia, predatory behavior, or harassment (**zero tolerance**).
- Do not impersonate staff or other players.
- Swearing is allowed, but **must remain respectful**.
- Keep chat **PG-13** appropriate — this is Minecraft, not a mature server.
- No spam or self-promotion without staff permission (including in DMs).

---

### ⚙️ Lag and Mods

- **No lag machines**; if a staff member asks you to modify a build causing lag, please cooperate.
- **No hacks, cheats, auto-clickers, or unfair advantage mods** (such as Xray).
- **Quality of life mods are allowed** — if unsure, open a ticket on our Discord to ask.
- Do not exploit bugs, glitches, or unintended game mechanics.
- If you find an exploit, **report it immediately** through a Discord ticket.

## 🏡 Towny-Specific Rules

- **No griefing**, even if the land is unclaimed.  
  (This includes lava casts, TNT craters, and other grief builds.)
- **Be considerate of your neighbors** — respect nearby builds and towns.
- **Stealing is allowed** only in **unclaimed** land.
- **Villagers** in trading halls must be kept in **1x1 slots** to help reduce server lag from AI movement.
